# Statistical Analysis on Life Expectancy Dataset using Python

## Introduction
This project focuses on performing **Statistical Analysis in Python** using a **Life Expectancy dataset**. The goal is to analyze various factors affecting life expectancy across different countries and years. By applying statistical techniques and data visualization, the project uncovers patterns and correlations that offer insights into health trends globally.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries (see Requirements).
3. Load the dataset and follow along with the provided Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis step-by-step.
4. Run the cells to generate visualizations, perform statistical tests, and view results.

## Description
The analysis includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and handling missing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating summary statistics and visualizing trends.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Applying techniques such as correlation analysis and regression to explore relationships between life expectancy and socio-economic factors.
- **Insights**: Detailed exploration of key variables like population, and health-related factors.
- **Visualizations**: Using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful plots and graphs.
